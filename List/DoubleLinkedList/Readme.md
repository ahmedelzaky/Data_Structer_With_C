## Features

- **Append and Push**: Add elements to the end or beginning of the list.
- **Get and Set Data**: Retrieve or modify the data at a specific index.
- **Delete and Insert**: Remove or insert elements at a specific index.
- **Size**: Get the size (number of elements) of the list.
- **Display**: Print the list and its reverse.
- **Sort**: Sort the list in ascending order.
- **Search**: Find the index of a specific element.
- **Memory Management**: Properly handles memory allocation and deallocation.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries

## Usage

The program demonstrates how to use the provided doubly linked list functions. It creates three different linked lists and performs various operations on them. You can modify the `main` function in `main.c` to suit your specific use case.

## Functionality

- `appendNode`: Adds a node to the end of the list.
- `pushNode`: Adds a node to the beginning of the list.
- `getNodeData`: Retrieves data at a specific index.
- `setNodeData`: Sets data at a specific index.
- `deleteNode`: Deletes a node at a specific index (not yet implemented).
- `insertNode`: Inserts a node at a specific index (not yet implemented).
- `getListSize`: Gets the size of the list.
- `displayList`: Displays the list.
- `displayListReverse`: Displays the list in reverse.
- `sortList`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- `searchInList`: Searches for an element and returns its index.
